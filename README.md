A lab with the purpose of building a 32-bit RISC-V (RV32) interpreter in C that will receive, 
parse, and execute RISC-V instructions as strings. The interpreter will not be a simulator 
as it does not mimic the hardware operation (e.g., utilizing clock cycles), but the resulting 
registers and memory should reflect what you would find after executing real RV32 instructions.
